Project in progress...

Done in colaboration with ttokesi (tomah56 on here).

This projectâ€™s objectives are: Rigor, use of C, use
of basic algorithms, information research etc.

As a graphic design project, cub3D will enable us to improve our skills in these
areas: windows, colors, events, fill shapes, etc.

To conclude cub3D is a remarkable playground to explore the playful practical appli-
cations of mathematics. With the help of the numerous documents available on the internet, we will use
mathematics as a tool to create elegant and efficient algorithms.
